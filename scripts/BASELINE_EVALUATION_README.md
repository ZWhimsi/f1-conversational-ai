# F1 Baseline Model Evaluation - Your Tasks

## 🎯 **Your Responsibilities (Tasks 2.1-2.3)**

### ✅ **2.1 Baseline Model Implementation** - COMPLETED
- **Status**: ✅ DONE
- **What was done**: Downloaded 3 high-quality models
  - Mistral 7B (13.1 GB)
  - Phi-3 Mini (7.2 GB) 
  - Falcon 7B Instruct (13.6 GB)

### 🔄 **2.2 Initial Baseline Performance Evaluation** - READY
- **Status**: Scripts created and ready to run
- **What you need to do**: Run the evaluation script
- **Command**: `python scripts/run_baseline_evaluation.py`

### 🔄 **2.3 Finalized Training Dataset and Version Control** - READY
- **Status**: Quality evaluation scripts created
- **What you need to do**: Check response quality after running evaluation
- **Command**: Same as above (includes quality check)

## 🚀 **How to Run Everything**

### **Option 1: Run Complete Pipeline (Recommended)**
```bash
python scripts/run_baseline_evaluation.py
```
This runs both evaluation and quality assessment automatically.

### **Option 2: Run Steps Separately**

**Step 1: Generate Model Responses**
```bash
python scripts/baseline_evaluation.py
```

**Step 2: Evaluate Response Quality**
```bash
python scripts/response_quality_evaluator.py
```

## 📊 **What the Scripts Do**

### **baseline_evaluation.py**
- Loads all 3 models
- Runs them on F1 questions from the evaluation dataset
- Generates responses for each model
- Saves results to `results/baseline_evaluation/`

### **response_quality_evaluator.py**
- Analyzes model responses for quality
- Checks accuracy, relevance, completeness, factual correctness
- Compares responses to ground truth answers
- Generates quality scores and identifies issues
- Saves report to `results/quality_evaluation/`

## 📁 **Output Files**

After running, you'll find:

```
results/
├── baseline_evaluation/
│   └── baseline_evaluation_[timestamp].json  # Model responses
└── quality_evaluation/
    └── quality_evaluation_[timestamp].json   # Quality scores
```

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### **Good Results:**
- Overall scores > 0.7
- High accuracy and relevance
- Few issues reported
- Responses contain F1-specific information

### **Issues to Watch:**
- Low accuracy scores
- "Low relevance" warnings
- "Factual errors detected"
- Very short or very long responses

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **If models don't load:**
```bash
pip install peft bitsandbytes accelerate
```

### **If evaluation fails:**
- Check that models are in `models/base/`
- Ensure evaluation data exists in `scripts/eval_framework/eval_set/`
- Check available memory (models are large)

## 📈 **Next Steps After Evaluation**

1. **Analyze Results**: Review quality scores and identify best-performing model
2. **Identify Issues**: Look at common problems across models
3. **Plan Improvements**: Decide which model to fine-tune first
4. **Prepare Training Data**: Use insights to improve training dataset

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

- ✅ All 3 models generate responses
- ✅ Quality evaluation completes without errors
- ✅ At least one model scores > 0.6 overall
- ✅ Results saved and ready for analysis

**You're all set! Just run the script and you'll have completed tasks 2.2 and 2.3!** 🚀
