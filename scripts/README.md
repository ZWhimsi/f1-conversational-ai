# Scripts Directory

This directory will contain the implementation scripts for each phase of the F1 Conversational AI project.

## Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Data Curation - Web scraping, data ingestion, preprocessing
- **Phase 2**: Baseline Modeling - Pre-trained model evaluation
- **Phase 3**: Core Experimentation - Fine-tuning implementation
- **Phase 4**: Evaluation - Model evaluation framework
- **Phase 5**: Reporting - Results synthesis and visualization

## Implementation Notes

The detailed implementation scripts will be added as the project progresses. The current repository structure provides the foundation for:

- Modular development
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy navigation and maintenance
- Scalable architecture

## Usage

Scripts will be organized by phase and can be executed using the CLI utilities in the `utils/` directory.
