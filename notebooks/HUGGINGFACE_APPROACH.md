# F1 QA Evaluation - Hugging Face Hub Approach

## Quick Start (Recommended)

Your friend was right! Using Hugging Face Hub is much faster and more reliable than Google Drive uploads.

### What's Changed:

- **No more slow Google Drive uploads** - models load directly from Hugging Face
- **No more missing .safetensors files** - everything is handled automatically
- **Faster setup** - just run notebook 02 directly
- **More reliable** - no file corruption or incomplete downloads

### How to Use:

1. **Skip notebook 01** (model download) - it's now optional
2. **Run notebook 02** directly - it will load models from Hugging Face Hub
3. **Run notebook 03** for quality evaluation

### What the notebooks do now:

#### Notebook 01: Model Download (Optional)

- Only use if you want to cache models locally
- Downloads models to Google Drive for offline use
- **Skip this if you have good internet**

#### Notebook 02: QA Evaluation (Updated)

- Loads models directly from Hugging Face Hub
- No more file verification issues
- Much faster startup
- Models: Mistral 7B, Phi-3 Mini, Falcon 7B Instruct

#### Notebook 03: Quality Evaluation

- Uses OpenAI API to evaluate response quality
- Works with results from notebook 02

### Benefits of Hugging Face Approach:

âœ… **Faster**: No upload time, models load on-demand  
âœ… **More reliable**: No missing files or corruption  
âœ… **Always up-to-date**: Gets latest model versions  
âœ… **Less storage**: No need to store 13GB+ models locally  
âœ… **Easier**: Just run the evaluation notebook

### If you still want to use Google Drive:

You can still use the old approach by running notebook 01 first, but it's much slower and more error-prone.

### Next Steps:

1. Upload the updated notebooks to Google Colab
2. Run notebook 02 directly (skip notebook 01)
3. Set your OpenAI API key in Colab secrets for notebook 03
4. Enjoy much faster evaluation!

Your friend's suggestion was spot on - this is definitely the better approach! ðŸš€
